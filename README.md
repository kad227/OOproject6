> The website needs node js, to run. Use the command 'node server.js' once in the appropriate folder. All the supporting libraries can be added through node.js command prompt as well.



> For the scale use https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server on the 'data' folder to fetch the data for the scale. Then, go to the data folder and use the command 'http-server', then run Smartscale.py!
